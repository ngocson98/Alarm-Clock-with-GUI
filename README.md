# Alarm-Clock-with-GUI

# Develop an Alarm Clock

## About the Python Project
The objective of our project is to implement an alarm clock using Python. Some very innovative libraries such as datetime and tkinter which help us to build the project using the current date and time as well as to provide a user interface to set the alarm according to the requirement in 24-hour format.

## Prerequisites
This project requires good knowledge of Python and GUI (Graphic User Interface). Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. All the modules used need not be downloaded beforehand like the other libraries like NumPy, thus this project will be user friendly and accessible in any virtual environment used for python programming.

## Project File Structure
   First, let’s check the steps to build an Alarm Clock program in Python:
   + Importing all the libraries and modules required
   + Putting forward a while loop which takes the argument of the time, the user wants to set the alarm on and              automatically breaks when the time is up, with sound
   + Create a display window for user input.
    
### 1. First, we import all the necessary libraries and modules:

            from tkinter import *
            import datetime
            import time
            import winsound

#### Explanation:
   + Tkinter module belongs to a standard library of GUI in Python. It helps us to create a dialog box with any              information that we want to provide or get from the users.
   + Datetime and time modules in python help us to work with the dates and time of the current day when the user is        operating python and to manipulate it too.
   + Winsound module provides access to the basic sound playing machinery provided by Windows platforms. This is useful      to generate the sound immediately when a function is called.
